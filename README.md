# ConvetCodetoLength

One day this in school one of the students came up to another one of my classmates and wanted to know how long his code was for an assignment. He responds by moving his hands apart and going, "About this long". We got all got a good chuckle out of it and it gave me the idea to write a super simple program that will read any source file and convert it to feet. 

To run it just download it chang the file name to whatever file you want compile and let it go.
