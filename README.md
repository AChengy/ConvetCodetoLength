# ConvetCodetoLength

So there is a kid at our school who would always go around asking people how long their code is. One day I decided to write a 
little crappy program that would take a source code find how long each line is and then calculate the length. The font size 
is based on 10 pt standard sans-serif font .8 em. 

It's short and not good but it allows me to sarcastically answer questions on how long my code is.
